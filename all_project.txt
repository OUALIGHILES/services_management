The application is based on seamlessly connecting service providers with customers.
The customer selects the required service, and different categories are displayed, such as:

Water tankers with different capacities

Sand transport vehicles

Once the service is requested, the order is sent to all registered drivers within the same category.
Two possible workflows are supported:

Direct acceptance of the order

Offer-based system, where drivers submit price offers

This gives the customer full flexibility to choose the most suitable offer.

The system also ensures smooth communication between the customer and the driver, with the ability to add notes and images.
At the same time, the administration can easily track and manage all orders from the control panel.
